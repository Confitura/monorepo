  "bio" : "I'm a Software Engineer with industry experience in designing and implementing complex applications and systems, mostly where it's not visible to users - at the backend.\nI'm a self-taught developer and a hands-on learner, constantly working towards expanding my knowledge further.\n\nI contribute to several open source projects, my main focus being sttp (where you can see my contributions on the project's Github). \n\nI appreciate the exchange of technical know-how - which is expressed by my various publications found on Medium and DZone, and appearances at top tech conferences and meetups, including Devoxx Belgium. I enjoy exploring topics that combine software engineering and mathematics.\n\nIn my free time, I like to read a good book.",

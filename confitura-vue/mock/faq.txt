  "content" : "## After conference\n\n#### When the presentations will be available?\nAfter the recordings of all of them will be processed. Probably ~3 months.\n\n#### Are slides available?\nWe don't collect them so you should contact speakers directly (or check their twitter, sometimes they post it there).\n\n## Registration\n\n#### Did you sent registration links yet?\nYes! :)\n\nUnless you just registered... we send them from time to time\n\n#### Is everything OK with my registration?\nYou can check it by yourself! After [login](https://2018.confitura.pl/login) just click on 'profile' and you should see proper info. \n\n#### Can I give someone my ticket or voucher?\nYes. Go to [registration form](https://2018.confitura.pl/registration/form) and save it with empty voucher. After that you can give voucher to someone else.\nChanges should be visible in your profile.\n\n#### How big are the t-shirts?\nYou need to check it here:\n - [for ladies](https://share.adler.info/files//label/122---product_size.pdf)\n - [for gentlemen](https://share.adler.info/files//label/110---product_size.pdf)\n \n#### How can I buy tickets?\nTo get a ticket you will have to make a small donation to charity via our auctions on [Allegro Charytatywni](http://charytatywni.allegro.pl/). \nSee [registration page](https://2018.confitura.pl/registration)\n\n#### How much will the ticket cost?\n30z≈Ç\n\n#### When will you start selling the tickets?\nFull schedule is on [registration page](https://2018.confitura.pl/registration)\n\n#### Can I buy multiple tickets?\nYes, you can.\n\n#### Can I get an invoice?\nNo. If you \"buy\" the ticket it's actually a donation directly to charity and you can book it as one.\n\n#### I have missed a registration process, can I attend the conference?\nSorry, because of so many attendees, it is impossible. If you are interested in Confitura talks, you can join our streaming (link soon). Feel invited also to join Warszawa JUG meetups and Confitura 2019 edition.\n\n#### But I really, really, really want to attend the conference. Can I??\nSorry, but still no...\n\n#### I have bought the ticket, but I didn't get any email with registration link.\nImporting users who paid for their tickets from allegro to Jelatyna (our system) is a manual process. You should get an email up to a week after paying for your ticket.\n\n#### When will I get my e-ticket?\ne-tickets, in form of QR codes, will be e-mailed to you around a week before the conference.\n\n#### What if I didn't get registration email/e-ticket ?\nDrop us a message about it : confitura@confitura.pl\n\n## Call 4 Papers\n#### How long is C4P open?\nUntil 4th of April\n\n#### How much time do I have for my presentation?\nPresentations are 45 minutes long. Including q'n'a session.\n\n#### When will I know if my talk has been accepted?\nWe will publish C4P results around mid-May.\n\n#### I have reported multiple talks, is it possible that more than one will be accepted?\nOur rule of thumb is to accept at most one presentation from each speaker.\n\n## Vote 4 Papers\n\n#### What is this whole Vote 4 Papers process?\nAfter you submit the presentation it will be exposed publicly. Everyone will be able to vote on your presentation either that he/she is interested in it (+1), not interested at all(-1), or just don't care (0). Result of V4P will be an input for the decision made by the Confitura committee. \nVote 4 Papers is one of our Trade Marks, and we are proud of it :)\n\n#### There are a lot of talks reported. For sure some not everyone will go through the whole list. How do you make sure that each presentation gets equal number of votes?\nWe are aware of this problem. To deal with it we are randomizing the order of presentations for each voter. In our experience it helps a lot.\n\n## Conference day\n\n#### What time should I come?\nRegistration is open from 8 a.m. In the venue you can enjoy your morning coffee or tea and grab a sandwich, so you can join us very early in the morning :)\n\n#### What if I am late for the conference?\nNo worries, registration is open all day, you can register anytime.\n\n#### Can I attend other presentations than those marked as preferred?\nYes, that information was very helpful for us (planning etc.), but you can attend every talk you want to.\n\n#### What should I bring to a registration desk?\nYou need to have your e-ticket (QR code) with you. It can be printed or just presented on a screen (phone, tablet, laptop - we don't care).\n\n#### There are 5 different tracks, how to choose right talk?\nYeah, we know that it is hard to decide :) If you're not sure, check out briefs of presentations, discuss the issue with others (there so many networking options!). All presentations will be recorded. They will be available on our  [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVjQGf_e0JmlonPMS4VNXQ).\n\n#### Will the talks be recorded?\nYes, all talks will be recorded and available on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVjQGf_e0JmlonPMS4VNXQ) after Summer.\n\n#### Is there any mobile app for Confitura participants?\nWe used to have mobile app, but this year we have decided to deliver all that functionality (and more) on our website. And yes - it will be available offline.\n\n## Venue\n#### How to get to the conference venue?\nDetails are available [online](https://confitura.pl/about)  \n\n#### Is it possible to park a car at the venue?\nCar park next to Conference Centre can hold 100 of cars (note: it is paid). Another possibility is to park on the street.\n\n#### Do I have pay for a lunch?\nNo, at lunch break you can enjoy a light meal served in the venue. Yes if you go out to have a burger in a restaurant nearby :)\n\n#### Is there any WiFi available?\nIt is extremely difficult to provide reliable WiFi connection for such a big crowd. We don't want you to be annoyed due to constantly loosing connection. That's why we have decided not to provide wireless connection during Confitura and focus time saved on other aspects of the conference. \n\n## Workshops\n\n#### How can I buy tickets?\nTo register for the workshop, you will have to complete the appropriate registration form  [here](https://2018.confitura.pl/workshops) and pay a fee.\n\n#### Can I buy multiple tickets?\nYes, you can, but please note that two workshops take place at the same time.\n\n#### What if I didn't get registration email?\nFeel free to drop a message to the organizer at biuro@sages.com.pl\n\n#### What time should I come?\nRegistration is open from 8.30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and  from 01:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. In the venue you can enjoy your morning/afternoon coffee or tea, so you can join us earlier.\n\n#### What is the workshop schedule?\nThe workshops will run for 4 hours from 9:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. There will be at least one coffee break.\n\n#### What should I bring?\nThis is a BYOD (bring your own device) workshop, so remember to bring your own laptop.\n\n#### Where will the workshops take place?\nOur workshops will take place in Golden Floor Plaza, 123A Jerozolimskie Avenue, Warsaw, Poland.\n\n#### Will the workshops be recorded?\nNo, you can participate in person only.\n\n#### Is there any WiFi available?\nYes, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n\n## SPOINa\n\n#### Can everyone join an afterparty (SPOINa)?\nUnfortunately no. Spots are limited, but you can win an invitation by taking part in Q&amp;A sessions after presentations or by having a chat with organizers.\n\n#### Is any dress code required at SPOINa?\nOther than \"dressed\" - no :)\n\n#### So what does SPOINa mean anyway?\nIt is an acronym of polish words \"SPOtkanie INtegracyjne\" (eng. integration meeting). Spoina itself also means \"joint\" - so it fits very nicely :) Credit goes to [Jacek Laskowski](https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski) - founder of Confitura (which at that time was called Javarsovia)",

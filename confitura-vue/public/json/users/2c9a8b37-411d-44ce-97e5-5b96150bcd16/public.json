Moving from there to the BBC he managed Customer Facing Products, all the reusable parts of the BBC shared across iPlayer, News, Weather, Worldwide etc. and helped deliver v3 of iPlayer. As CTO of Online at ITV Paul stripped back and rebuilt the failing platform leading to the ITV Hub rebrand and relaunch. Moving into digital banking Paul spent a brief time at HSBC as Head of Engineering for Digital before moving to Tandem Bank to launch savings, credit card and mortgage products delivered via a digital experience. This involved migrating Tandem from the legacy Fiserv platform onto Mambu.

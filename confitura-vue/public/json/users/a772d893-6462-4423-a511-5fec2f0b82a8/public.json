  "bio" : "I'm an experienced DevOps Engineer and the leader of SoftwareMill's DevOps Team. Some refer to my position as 'YAML developer' :-). Over the past 20 years, I have been helping create amazing software for multiple organizations. I'm an avid user of Kubernetes and Cloud Computing, and, obviously, an enthusiast of the DevOps culture. In my free time, I like running and I regenerate while working in my garden.\n",

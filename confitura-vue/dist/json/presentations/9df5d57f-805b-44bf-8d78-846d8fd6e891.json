  "description" : "The whole world is crazy about microservices. In the JVM world, the first choice is Java. The second one is Kotlin.\nScala is very often considered a great tool for Big Data. However, I strongly believe that it may be also used as a tool to create microservices. It has many advantages and I would like to present some of them.\nOne of the brightest aspects of Scala is Akka which provides a very powerful environment for asynchronous communication. Unfortunately, Akka has changed the license. In my presentation, I will show how it can be replaced.",
